**Cleveland-Born, Open-Source Driven**  
*Building Truly Open AI Tools — No gimmicks, No confusing wording, OPEN.*

## 🔥 Our Mission  
We’re done with corporate "openwashing." Closed APIs pretending to be open? We're over that.  
**We build (and open-source) tools to democratize frontier AI:**  
- **Public by default** — Models, training data, code. No proprietary locks.  
- **Scalable & community-owned** — From startups to research labs, deploy anywhere.  
- **Ethical & transparent** — Governance by developers, not shareholders.  

---

## 🛠 What We Build  

### Open AI Training Framework  
- **Pre-training & fine-tuning** for text, multimodal, and custom models  
- **Data synthesis pipelines** — Clean, ethical datasets for any use case  
- **One-click deployment** — Run locally or scale to cloud clusters  

### Developer-First Tools  
- **Open evaluation suites** — Benchmark models without corporate bias  
- **Collaboration platforms** — Built for distributed teams and researchers  
- **Modular libraries** — Plug into existing workflows, no vendor lock-in  

---

## 🤝 Why Us?  

- **Local roots, global vision** — Cleveland-founded, solving problems that scale  
- **Built for developers** — Tools we actually use ourselves  
- **Venture-backed ambition** — Scaling infrastructure, not selling out
