## 🔥 Our Mission  
We’re done with corporate "openwashing." Closed-up proprietary companies pretending to be open? We're over that. 
**We build (and open-source) tools to help democratize frontier AI:**
- **Public** — Models we make: these will include all training data, code. No proprietary locks.
- **Ethical & transparent** — Governance by developers and society, not shareholders or such influence.
- **Helpful software** — One of our many passions is building useful and creative software to achieve goals and solve problems.
- **Exploring** — We're tinkerers at heart and have a passion for learning new things and applying ourself even outside of the software domain.
