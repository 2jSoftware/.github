## 🔥 Our Mission  
We’re done with corporate "openwashing." Closed-up proprietary companies pretending to be open? We're over that. 
**We build (and open-source) tools to help democratize frontier AI:**
- **Public** — Models we make- these will include all training data, code. No proprietary locks.
- **Ethical & transparent** — Governance by developers, not shareholders.
